@topandrun126,So my s23 ultra was having a overheating problem after a update. It gets so hot sometimes i have to turn it off wet a towel and wrap it up to cool it down. One night after doing that the phone just power off try a few things until next day the phone turn on at this point I already created a ticket cost $107.. for Samsung repair. They look at the phone and said is water damage and it will cost a extra $875 for the complete repair. I gently ask to return my phone as it is. If wasn't for secure folder option i would not get a next Samsung phone,2024-09-17T12:25:40Z,0,Galaxy S25,Samsung,Flagship,"January 5, 2025"

The leaks about the size of the S25s batteries 🔋 and photo sensors don't really bode well for anything new and good, and as Samsung fans, these aren't things to applaud, we're fans, not shareholders or worshippers.

The thing is people still buy it either for bragging or because they eat up the small innovations if any. The older flagships gave you more i mean the note 20 ultra had sd card support etc and then they took it away alongside taking the spen just to bring the s pen back but still take away the sd support. Dex is a super important tool for me and i love using the pen but without meaningful upgrades im leaning more and more towards the china market.

@shalein6688,Smartphone innovation has peaked. These small changes doesn't define if people need to upgrade. They should be  launching  smartphones now every 2 years with atleast 1 innovative feature which atleast give a reason to upgrade.  Now a days people hold on to their smart phone atleat for 3 to 4 years.,2024-09-15T21:26:17Z,0,Galaxy S25,Samsung,Flagship,"January 5, 2025"

@T-Sign,"I love samsung phones since my very young age... & loves even now also & can say its best of best... but tbh i miss those days, when samsung used to spend alot of money on R&d & use to came with unique designs every years with s series & a series... but since 2022, they r literally just improving little on design, exactly what apple is doing with their phones... which literally makes the feeling of having a new phone kinda gone... like for a samsung user, they r totally familiar with one ui properly, so when he or she is buying a new samsung phone, from inside it's literally same & nowadays from outside as well... & worst thing... from cheapest to costliest models... all look same, which tbh samsung did terrific... samsung should at least now needs to change the design for s25 series means physical appearance... otherwise they r just following apple trend, which is worst... coz samsung never like apple... samsung is better than apple always🙌",2024-09-15T21:18:10Z,18,Galaxy S25,Samsung,Flagship,"January 5, 2025"

@jamescentersmith9323,"I'm honestly not really sure why Samsung keeps coming out with newer models every 8 months or so. I got the S24 when it first came out and a tiny bit under a year or less than a year they come out with a brand new model and it's like really you can't just wait five years for the next model. It doesn't even have to be that long. It could be a year and a half until the next model comes out or two years. But, you know, no more than two years. I mean, you still want to, you know, with new technology. It seems like they are going to at some point run out of ideas before they are basically just doing slightly new designs and nothing actual new on the inside. It's all going to be outside appearances that's going to be new at some point because they're going to run out of ideas for what works on the inside, and how it performs. The normal base models all seem to be the same lately. The next Samsung I get is probably going to be an ultra instead of a normal base model. That way I'm at least getting some kind of upgrade. And by the time I need an upgrade, it's probably going to be when the S26 or S27 Ultra comes out. Or maybe when the S30 Ultra comes out, who knows? 😂",2024-09-15T20:58:44Z,0,Galaxy S25,Samsung,Flagship,"January 5, 2025"

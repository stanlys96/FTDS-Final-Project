@madboyreadynow28,"Reading the reviews, it's clear people forgot that iPhone and Samsung phones have always been slim but amazing. I think people are confusing slim was small. They're still going to have larger displays just slim which means lighter. They started getting thicker and heavier the S22 Ultra and Iphone 12 pro Max. Both Apple and Samsung are about to give us new slim devices. Currently, these phones are so thick and heavy that you can't go for a walk with them in your pocket because they are uncomfortable. Slimmer phones will be a hit. Reading the comments of people saying they don't want a slim phone when just 4 years ago, all phones were slim. The iPhone 11 pro max was slim.

they copied the removal of the charger headphone jack expandable storage cheap trash design of the flat sides on the iPhone, they copied the stupid move of using titanium and now they ruined one ui's notification shade which they are ruining even more on one ui 7 now they are ruining the galaxy brand further than when they did away with the note series now we have 3 S phones 2 actually related and a third with a cringe ""ultra"" next to it's name an ultra phone wouldn't need to tell me it's ""pro"" or ""ultra"" I'm 23 years old Samsung...
the A series has been trash with unnecessary ""upgrades"" like glass backs and many many many downgrades and very low soc power compared to the competition bloated af below the a3# like the a0# is disgustingly bad the a1# is not much better and the a2# is bearable at best which should replace the a0# regardless the A series has been ruining the reputation of android since they started using 2 digits.
there are many other things I can comment on with Samsung but we'll be here all day I did that, don't get me started on their tab line up the 1600usd mobile soc notched garbage...
we really just need 3 tablets 1 A one S and one Note tablet (replacing the ultra), 2 S phones, 1 note, 3 A series devices (2cameras max on each no unnecessary garbage all of them with polycarbonate backs) the fan edition could be the experimental all out phone that adds every feature under the sun just because that's what the ""fans"" actually want and the S series are the ones that push boundaries with the latest and greatest the note are the ones that do what works",2024-11-04T14:37:11Z,1,Galaxy S25 Slim,Samsung,Flagship,Mid-2025

@Vahndamme,"On the topic of the 4 S-lineup.. I'd expect the base S24 to either remain same size and Slim to take the Plus size over. As it definitely needs to be bigger to pack as much as possible in slim form factor. And Ultra will remain Ultra. 

There is a chance for base S to move to Plus size and just have a Slim variant (same size) next to it but then they'll need way more data on the demand of Slim. Atm you want a weaker base S (also smaller - tried and tested) with a Slim that has some drawbacks but some of them 'fixed' bcuz well.. it's bigger. But basically it's a slim plus phone so overall.. people lose choice and possibly need to do a bigger jump if they want best specs with biggest screen.",2024-11-03T19:12:05Z,0,Galaxy S25 Slim,Samsung,Flagship,Mid-2025

@Vahndamme,"Imagine the iPhone 17 Air sporting a M-series chip running super efficiently. Also, it could open the door for full M-chip on iPhones.. tho it would make little sense because the A Bionic chips are already so good and well.. bringing that to iPhones would beg the question for them to introduce a Dex style like software.. where you can dock iPhone and work on a bigger screen or w/e.. probably down the line in the future as products keep improving. Tho this thought of making slim and pocketable devices so powerful always begs the question.. wouldn't it destroy the tablet/laptop or small pc's game.. since well.. all it takes is real software on those smaller devices that makes the real difference. Look at the iPad Pro for example.. only reason it's not competing with MacBooks is iPad OS limiting capabilities.. which is done on purpose for sure. Imagine this power and/or efficiency going to smartphones.. 😅 all it takes is full fleshed software and boom, all other categories could be hurt. Though I see no other future, as in.. future future.. by then I don't think companies will be able to hold themselves from not busting out a smartphone capable of all the computational power so that it can run majority of people's usecases on just a screen and maybe some peripherals.",2024-11-03T19:07:23Z,0,Galaxy S25 Slim,Samsung,Flagship,Mid-2025

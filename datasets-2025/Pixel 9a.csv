@mysticery,"Honestly... If this look becomes made and trickle down to the design of the poxel 10 onwards,... Lets hope there will be no sacrifices in terms of hardware.. google design team are so fixated on really weird design choices and decisions. Even on the rhe pixel 9 series,.. the bottom firing speakers have moved to the left side.. why! Now i have hold the phone a certain way in landscape so i dont block the speakers.

@gautamnaik8812,Let's be real this looks like some old junk from 6 years ago. The bezel is gonna be the same ugly factor for not buying the phone. The pixel 7a felt far better if we took bezels into consideration. Rather spend a bit more buy 9 on festive offers. The pixel 8 had such a low price last month similarly the pixel 9's price will drop.,2024-10-26T08:29:12Z,2,Pixel 9a,Google,Mid-Range,2025

@saqlain0911,"REDMI is losing it's USP 😢

Redmi series is now not doing stand out changes like what it was doing at the time of note 5 to note 9

also not coming at agressive prices like before 

now, it's own subbrand-Poco, iqoo moto, vivo T series are offering more at same price 

even a Xiaomi fan also won't like this changes 😂 like me",2024-09-27T12:56:16Z,25,Redmi Note 14 Series,Xiaomi,Mid-Range,2025
